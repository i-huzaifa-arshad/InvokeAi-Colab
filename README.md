# InvokeAi-Colab Notebooks

Don't have a powerful GPU? No worries. 

Enjoy using InvokeAI through these easy to use Colab Notebooks.

This repository has 3 colab notebooks for:
  - InvokeAI v5.2.0 (Latest)
  - InvokeAI v3.6.2 (Old version)
  - InvokeAI v3.4.0 (Old version)

which means you will enjoy latest InvokeAi Webui and all the latest features. 

Just run the notebook and enjoy using InvokeAI.

Note: Please note due to the restrictions implemented by Google on Colab for using Stable Diffusion on Free Tier, you can face frequent runtime disconnections.
      In this case, just switch to other google account and run the notebook there as it always works ðŸ˜‰
